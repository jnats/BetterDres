        DresSrfLandedHighlands = You notice there is very hard ground under a soft layer of gravel.
        DresSrfLandedPoles = You notice there is very hard ground under a soft layer of gravel. But there seems to be something else there too.. Oh! it's a... it's a... IT'S A LOOTCRATE! But then you realize that it is not, it's in fact just a small rock.
        DresSrfLandedMidlands = This Midlands seem like they are in the middle of the planet... Weird. this surface sample is brought by Middle Snacks(TM), They are in the middle of taste.
        DresSrfLandedLowlands = You hack off a bit of the rock, it seems oddly dark.
        DresSrfLandedRidges = The ground reminds you of the Kerbolar Wars Pre-Sequels, you get excited at first but then you find out nothing is interesting about the ground itself.
        DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta = You pick up bits off the ground, it seems like they came from a volcanic eruption. Maybe Dres is alive with activity under the boring-looking surface after all?
        DresSrfLandedImpactCraters = It seems like an asteroid crashed here.. The ground seems to be almost sandy here.
        DresSrfLandedCanyons = Strange, you seem to pick up some signs of trapped air inside the rock...
        OgSrfLandedOg = The brown rock you landed on seems awfully brittle, almost as if you'd thrust too hard it'd shatter.
        PuffSrfLandedPuff = You try to pick up a rock but as you bring down your pick, but Kewton's Third Law pushes you away.
        DootSrfLandedDootEquatorialRidge = The rock here is unnaturally dense, but still not dense enough to cause Doot's intense gravity for its size.
        DootSrfLandedDoot = You attempt to pick up a small chunk of small, grey rock on the ground but you can't, it's far too heavy.
