    Og = A solitary moon of Dres, it overlooks the 3 smaller moons, and keeps everything in the Dresian system in check.
    Puff = A small, mischievous moon, some say that it's almost impossible to land on. Will you be the first to accept that challenge?
    Panca = A tiny, flat and pancake-shaped moon orbiting around Dres. It spins so fast that people say it's impossible to land on.
    Doot = An incredibly dense rock, with a peculiar equatorial ridge, making it's way around Dres. Could this be the cause of the gravitational anomaly we found earlier..?
