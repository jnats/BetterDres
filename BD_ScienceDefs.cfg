        DresSrfLandedPoles = You notice there is very hard ground under a soft layer of gravel. but there seems to be something else there too. Oh, its, its, ITS A LOOTCRATE! But then you realize that it is not, just a small rock.
        DresSrfMidlands = This Midlands seem like they are in the middle of the planet... Werid. this surface sample is brought by Middle SnacksTM, They are in the middle of taste.
        DresSrfLowlands = You chop off a bit of the rock, it seems weridly dark.
        DresSrfRidges = The ground reminds you have the sun wars prequels, you get excited at first but then you find out nothing is interesting about it.
        DresSrfImpactEjecta = You pick up bits off the ground it seems like they came from a volcanic explosion. It seems like Dres is alive with activity under the boring looking surface.
        DresSrfImpactCraters = it seems like something crashed here. maybe from the a deorbited asteroid from dres' orbit. anyways the ground seems to crack apart.
        DresSrfCanyons = very interesting, you seem to pick up some signs of locked air inside some of the ground...
