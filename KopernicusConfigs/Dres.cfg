            description = Dres is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. It took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet. Due to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space, this dwarf planet was officially labeled as not to be trusted by the scientific community. That was until the kerbals found a atmosphere and some moons, the atmosphere still confuses top kerbal scientists. as Dres should not be able to hold it, maybe a future mission will bring more light.
