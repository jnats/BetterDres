# BetterDres for KSP v1.5.*

### What does it do?
- Makes Dres slightly less inclined, from 5° in Stock KSP, to 2° in BetterDres
- Adds a few tiny moons to keep Dres company.
- All-new ScienceDefs!
- Five new biomes to explore.
And a very thin atmosphere around Dres! The canyons may or may not be involved...

### That sounds great! How do I get this mod?
Well, person reading this README.md, it's actually very, very easy!

1. Download the latest release of this mod
2. Open it in WinRar (or any other program that an open .rar files!)
3. Drag the BetterDres folder from the .rar into your GameData folder!

It's that simple!

### Magnificent! But will it be supported by my other cool mods?
Of course it will! BetterDres works with any mod that doesn't alter Dres directly! It will also work together with these supported mods:

- PlanetShine
- DistantObjectEnhancement
- ResearchBodies

Panca's and Puff's heightmap WAS one of GregroxMun's "Ellipsoid" textures. We have created our own heightmaps which are not ownership of GregroxMun but Zherdev.
This isn't to say of course that we weren't thankful for the time we were using his textures, as they were a good stepping stone and indicator of what we wanted to do with the mod.
